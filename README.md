This repo is a proof of concept of an idea for using Generative AI (GenAI) for Search Engine Optimiztation (SEO). The basic premise is to have a Large Language Model (LLM) make recommendations for improving a site's performance in a given web search, when provided with a list of keywords that top search results include:

```
Keywords:
Step into a world of opul,A weekend getaway or a we,Indulge your pets with th,"Emma is reliable and rea,Offering Pet Services wit


Recommendations from the LLM:
Based on the keywords provided, here are some recommendations to optimize your site for the search "Pet sitting service Eau Claire":

1. **Descriptive Language**: Use descriptive and enticing language to detail your services. Phrases like "world of opulence and extravagance", "treated like royalty", and "one-of-a-kind service" can help to attract potential customers and search engines.

2. **Service Variety**: Clearly outline the different services you offer. The top results include services like house sitting, playtime, and special treats. Make sure your site details what you offer in a clear and concise manner.

3. **Customer Comfort**: Emphasize the comfort and well-being of the pets. The keywords show that people value their pets' comfort and want them to be stress-free while they are away. Highlight how your service ensures this.

```

Outline of the process:
1. Conduct a web search and fetch the contents of e.g. the first 10 results.
2. Clean the contents and cluster the text.
3. Find the largest clusters and their centroids; the theory is that the largest clusters represent the words or phrases used most often in top results and the centroids are good representations of each cluster.
4. Present the centroids to the LLM along with the original search, and have the LLM make recommendations based on the search and the words that seem to show up the most often in the top results.
